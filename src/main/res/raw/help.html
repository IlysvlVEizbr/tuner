<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>An android accordion tuner with strobe, staff and multiple notes.</p>

<h3>Using</h3>

<p>
  Hold the phone/tablet near the instrument, play a note and observe
  the display. In portrait the app shows a scope with the input
  signal, a spectrum showing the processed signal, the main display
  with the note value, cents error, frequency error etc, a strobe
  display or staff display and a meter display showing the cents
  error. In landscape the app shows just the main display or staff and
  the meter. There is a signal indicator in the action bar which is
  useful in landscape mode. Using the touch setting changes below
  causes a short notification message to pop up for a few seconds.
</p>

<h4>Temperaments</h4>

<p>
  The app defaults to <b>equal</b> temperament and the key
  of <b>C</b>. 32 temperaments are available in the settings. For any
  temperament other than equal it is necessary to set the key to be
  used for that temperament. Note that the display may show a cents
  variation greater than 50 for some notes in some temperament due to
  the interval between notes being greater than 100 cents.
</p>

<h4>Custom Temperaments</h4>

<p>
  You may load custom temperaments by placing a file
  in <b>Tuner/Custom.txt</b>. The file should contain one or more
  entries formatted as property entries. The format is
  documented <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Properties#load(java.io.Reader)">here</a>.
